# 🚀 **Efficient-DSA**: Accelerating Algorithms with C++ and Rust 🚀

Welcome to the **Efficient-DSA** repository! This project aims to make traditional Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) more efficient by leveraging modern multithreading, concurrency, and performance-boosting techniques using C++ and Rust. 🌟

## 🔥 Introduction

This repository explores how we can modernize traditional DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using advanced techniques like multithreading, parallelism, and concurrency in both **C++** and **Rust**. By utilizing these concepts, we can speed up DSA algorithms and make them fit for high-performance applications. 🏎️💨

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- **C++**: Known for its strong performance capabilities and threading features, like `pthread` and `std::thread`. 🧵
- **Rust**: Celebrated for its memory safety and efficient concurrency model, Rust allows us to write thread-safe code that performs exceptionally well. 🦀



## 🛠️ Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all types of contributions! Feel free to add new algorithms, optimize the existing ones, or fix bugs. If you’re new to contributing
